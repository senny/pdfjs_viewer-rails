  alt="full style"/>
</p>

**reduced**

## Usage

### Using the mountable Engine

The mountable engine makes it extremely simple to integrate the PDF.js viewer
into your application:

*config/routes.rb*
```ruby
mount PdfjsViewer::Rails::Engine => "/pdfjs", as: 'pdfjs'
```

Now you can use a link in your templates to open up the viewer:

```erb
<%= link_to "display using the full viewer", pdfjs.full_path(file: "/sample.pdf") %>
<%= link_to "display using the minimal viewer", pdfjs.minimal_path(file: "/sample.pdf") %>
```

### Using the helper

If your integration scenario is more complex you may want to consider using the
`pdfjs_viewer` helper. This allows you to embed the viewer into a container like
an iframe.

```erb
<%= pdfjs_viewer pdf_url: "/sample.pdf", style: :full %>
<%= pdfjs_viewer pdf_url: "/sample.pdf", style: :minimal %>
```

NOTE: The helper will render a full HTML document and should not be used in a layout.

### Cross-origin checks

To enable loading of PDFs at remote hosts, the following configuration option must be set in an initialiser:

  ```ruby
  PdfjsViewer.hosted_viewer_origins = ["http://yourhost.com", "https://yourhost.com"]
  ```

Replacing `yourhost.com` for your own domain. CORS headers must still be set correctly on the remote host.

## Development

Tests can be executed with:

```
$ bundle exec rake
```

This will render the sample.pdf using phantomjs and save screenshots into `test/sandbox`.
